  	  <h2>Who are we ?</h2>
  	  <p>
  	  	Cristo Sariente Library Collective is a sound design/production company formed with the intention of delivering original sounds for producers to sample that are hassle-free on the clearance side & to fill the void for fans of library music.

		    This collective's work has been grammy nominated & used by artists like: Drake, Future, Don Toliver, 6lack, Ryan Trey, Oktavian, FRVRFRIDAY, PA Salieu and more...
  	  </p>

      <h2>What do we sell ?</h2>
      <p>
        Our collective propose sample packs, with original sound design and textures. All sounds were meticulously recorded, arranged, and mixed in order to deliver quality samples for your production. Combining acoustic and electric instruments, vintage synthesizers, and the layering of vocals from our composers. The sounds can be used for beats but also for avdertising and cinema. Our online shop will be available soon via Payhip.
